# My First Python Program - PyJoke

Welcome to my first Python project!
In this program, I am using the `pyjoke` module to generate random jokes.
It's a fun and simple way to learn how to use Python libraries and enjoy some light humor along the way.

## Requirements

To run this program, you need Python 3.x installed and the `pyjoke` library. You can install the `pyjoke` module using pip:
BASH: pip install pyjoke
